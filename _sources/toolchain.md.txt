# Toolchain documentation

The `beet` toolchain makes it possible to process data packs and resource packs. It provides a unified developer experience for any tool that you might want to use to support your development workflow. The command-line utility allows you to link your project to minecraft and run the build process anytime you make a modification.

This page is still a work-in-progress.

## Build process overview

The build process is at the core of the `beet` toolchain. The toolchain first loads your project and config file, and then creates an empty context object holding a blank data pack and a blank resource pack. This context object is then sequentially handed over to each plugin in the `beet` [pipeline](#plugin-pipeline) configured by your project. The [pipeline](#plugin-pipeline) provides a composable execution model that allows you to combine plugins that cooperate to populate the output data pack and resource pack.

## Plugin pipeline

The entire [build process](#build-process-overview) revolves around the `beet` pipeline. The pipeline is responsible for loading and running the provided plugins. Plugins are simple functions that are called one after the other on the context object. The `beet` context holds all the data related to the build, such as the data pack, the resource pack, the template manager, or the cache handle.

```python
from beet import Context, Function

def greet(ctx: Context):
    """Plugin that adds a function for greeting the player."""
    ctx.data["greet:hello"] = Function(["say hello"])
```

Plugins can require other plugins at any point. Plugins required by other plugins are called plugin dependencies. Requiring a plugin makes sure that the plugin has been executed before going on. The pipeline makes sure that each distinguishable plugin only runs once, allowing multiple plugins to depend on a shared set of plugins. Requiring plugin dependencies effectively extends the pipeline dynamically, while it's running.

```python
from beet import FunctionTag

def greet_on_load(ctx: Context):
    """Plugin that calls the greeting function on load."""
    ctx.require(greet)
    ctx.data["minecraft:load"] = FunctionTag({"values": ["greet:hello"]})
```
