# Beet documentation

Welcome! This is the place where you'll eventually find everything there is to know about the `beet` project. The documentation is currently a work-in-progress. You're welcome to help write guides and contribute example use-cases. In the meantime, don't be afraid to check out the code!

You can ask questions about `beet` and get general help about Minecraft map-making on the Minecraft Commands discord server. [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/154777837382008833?color=7289DA&label=discord&logo=discord&logoColor=fff)](http://discord.gg/QAFXFtZ)
